### About the project
This is an attempt to create as slim and minimal setup for `angular` and `electron` as possible. Removing all the test files and other clutter, providing a separation between backend(`electron`) and frontend(`angular`).

### How to run
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run in development(with angular's live reload) `npm run dev`
- Run in production (will add soon)
